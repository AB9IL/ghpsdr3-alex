ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml~
* default.properties
* mvn-production-build.sh
* mvn-production-build.sh~
* pom.xml
* pom.xml~
* proguard.cfg
* target/
* target/generated-sources/
* target/generated-sources/r/
* target/generated-sources/r/org/
* target/generated-sources/r/org/v1al/
* target/generated-sources/r/org/v1al/BuildConfig.java
* target/generated-sources/r/org/v1al/R.java
* target/maven-status/
* target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/
* target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/
* target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/
* target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/createdFiles.lst
* target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/inputFiles.lst

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi/libscrypt.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libscrypt.so
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/main/java/ => app/src/main/java/
* /home/alex/temp/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
